					Bangladesh is one of the fastest growing nation. Because of accelerated economic growth and increasing production, sooner or later, food waste will be major concern for Bangladesh. Bangladesh is ninth most populous and twelfth most densely populated country in the world. So, it will bear consequence of food loss if food waste problem is not solved.
					Food waste is basically a component of food loss. Any removal of food from the food supply chain which is fit for human consumption, or which has spoiled or expired because of economic behavior, poor stock management- is called food waste.
					<br>
					<br>
					Important components of this definition include:
					<div class="text-warning">
						<li>Food waste is a part of food loss, but the distinction between the two is not clearly defined.</li>
						<li>Food redirected to non-food chains (including animal feed, compost or recovery to bioenergy) is
							counted as food loss or waste.</li>
						<li>Plants and animals produced for food contain 'non-food parts' which are not included in 'food
							loss and waste'(these inedible parts are sometimes referred to as 'unavoidable food waste';</li>

					<p style="color: deepskyblue;">
					Bangladesh is a developing country. Every 7 th person in Bangladesh is an undernourished one who can’t
					acquire minimum energy requirements. Bangladesh has at least 24.4 million undernourished people,
					which is 15.1% of its population. On the other hand, Bangladeshi people wasting about 5.5% of total
					procured food. According to Global Hunger Index, Bangladesh ranked 88 th position. From these three
					studies, we can see that hunger is kind of alarming issue. It’s actually a logistic issue. Many restaurants,
					catering, event companies often waste plenty of leftover foods. They never want to figuring out how
					these leftover foods can be useful to needy people by donating those.

					</div>

					<br>
					<br>
					<div style="color: #32CD32;">
						<p>From this graph, we can see that, from 2006 to 2016, the prevalence of undernourishment dropped from 16.4% to 15.1%. Though the graph indicates reduction from previous years, but the situation is alarming. World Food Program (WFP) raised following issues:</p>
					</div>
					<div class="text-warning">
					<li>Undernutrition costs Bangladesh more than USD one billion in lost productivity every year, and even more in health care costs.</li>
					<li>Thirty-six percent of children (approx. 7 million) under the age of five are chronically undernourished; they are too short for their age, a condition known as stunting.</li>
					<li>Fourteen percent of children under five in Bangladesh are wasted (low weight-for-height).</li>
					<li>Despite growth in wages over the past five years, food price spikes place balanced diets beyond the reach of millions, particularly the urban poor and rural landless.</li>
					<li>Among women, 24 percent are underweight and 13 percent are short in stature, which increases the likelihood that their children will be stunted.</li>
					<li>About three and half percent are dying under five years. </li>
					<li>Even in the wealthiest households, 26 percent of children under the age of five are stunted, and 12 percent are wasted (have low weight-for-height). Clearly undernutrition is not restricted to the poorest families. </li>
					<li>A third of children from six months to just under five years of age are anemic.</li>
					<br>
					Our main goal is to connect underprivileged people and well-off people in the society in order to reduce hunger and undernutrition. If anyone want donate food, our volunteer team will pick up the food and conserve it. Then they will deliver those foods to any needy people.
